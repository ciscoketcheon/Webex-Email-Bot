# Webex-Email-Bot
A bot that can send email by taking in webex message chat input. 

t can help to close gap by sending remediation request to Cisco SMA, which then make use of the SMA/CES/ESA Search-and-Remediate (SAR) integration to remove convicted email from end Exchange mailboxes. 

This email bot is built on Webex-Bot-Starter (https://github.com/WebexSamples/webex-bot-starter). Added one more "send-email" command and you can add this function in to start sending email. If you dont have a webex bot yet, refer to the Webex-Bot-Starter instruction. Use the chat function here to add email feature.
